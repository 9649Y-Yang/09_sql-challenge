In the EmployeeSQL folder, there are several files.\
\
[Employee_ERD.PNG](https://github.com/9649Y-Yang/09_sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/Employee_ERD.PNG) is the ERD of the Employees homework database\
\
[QuickDBD-export.pdf](https://github.com/9649Y-Yang/09_sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/QuickDBD-export.pdf) is the summary of table information such as columns in table, data type and keys.\
\
[schema_QuickDBD-export.sql](https://github.com/9649Y-Yang/09_sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/schema_QuickDBD-export.sql) is the schema SQL to create tables in postgreSQL.\
\
The above three files are generated by QuickDBD, the schema SQL file is slightly modified by removing quotation marks("") as it is easy to work with postgreSQL without these quotation marks.\
\
\
[query.sql](https://github.com/9649Y-Yang/09_sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/query.sql) is the Data Analysis part in homework to find infomation from database.\
\
[Week9_SQL_bonus.ipynb](https://github.com/9649Y-Yang/09_sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/Week9_SQL_bonus.ipynb) The bonus part is done here to visually present the salary data.
